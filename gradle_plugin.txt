so guys today we are going to implement a java like plugin in gradle.
it wont be as much sophesticated as java plugin from the gradle itself. but it would be good enough.

so, we have some multiple things to keep in mind before proceding, 
- how we are going to proceed,
- what features does this support

# features first
- it should support dependencies, putting things on diffrent classpath, in java plugin called configurations
- it should support different source sets

# steps
- it's simple first make the package compile and run
- introduce the concept of souresets
- introduce dependencies and classpath

# impl
- first i would make simple tasks within build script
- then, i will create custom task types which does that for me in same file
- then, extract them to buildSrc file
- then, introduce the concept of plugin
- also, in the meantime i will try to see if i need to refactor those task type into different classes
    of their own, so it ease me with testing...


# notes
if i understand correctly there are two things, one is tasks which one can register with tasks container,
another is the type of the tasks.
we can create and register multiple tasks of same task type.
also, when a task is of some task type it can take like different paraments and act accordingly.
now, i understand when gradle said, you just configure the tasks, what they does are defined by the plugin.
i get it.
task type is like the class, the blueprint,
and task is the runtime object or just object, the instance of that class...



# old notes, first try...

tbh right now, i don't even know how to proceed...


FROM STICKY NOTE,
// now it's better to not. lol... still idk...
so, what i am thinking right now, is kind of like replicating that thing by myself,
like defining those tasks by myself, and like compiling and building and depends everything...
and then if possible, creating a plugin or something...
that would be so much helpful in understanding gradle build system
